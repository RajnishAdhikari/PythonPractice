    "You are a developer writing a Python application to synchronize a set of drones to perform a procedure in real time. This needs synchronous I/O multiplexing, implemented by performing non-blocking I/O using threads, each of which calls the select() system call on a set of read/write I/O ports. Which of the following is/are true for this application? Select all that apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Non-blocking I/O using multiple threads is possible since each of those threads can poll a single read/write port, and perform reads/writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B. In general, non-blocking I/O using multiple threads results in better performance than trying to poll the ports serially, since the select() system calls can be executed in parallel, even though the threads are executed one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C. The only way to achieve synchronous I/O multiplexing using select() as above, is to use the Python multiprocessing feature provided by concurrency.futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "D. The model discussed above is one of synchronous I/O multiplexing using select(), which is designed to work with blocking I/O. Thus, non-blocking I/O using several threads is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "E. We cannot achieve better performance using non-blocking I/O with multiple threads, as compared to serial execution since the underlying CPython GIL prevents the threads from achieving true parallelism."
